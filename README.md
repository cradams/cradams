## 🚀 My Story

I got my start running a game shop in Hattiesburg, Mississippi—learning leadership, logistics, and how to build systems that bring people together. That scrappy mindset still fuels me today.

For 15+ years, I’ve helped nonprofits, schools, and community orgs build meaningful digital infrastructure—from donor CRMs and secure servers to websites built for accessibility, performance, and purpose.

I believe in code that serves people. Systems that protect data. And digital spaces that reflect the values of the movements behind them.

Currently building out [House of Rhiju](https://rhiju.com), where tech meets transformation, and leading **Shepherd Digital** to support faith-based and justice-driven organizations.
